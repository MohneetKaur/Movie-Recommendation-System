Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system based on the content of movies. It utilizes a dataset of movies that includes information such as title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew. By processing and analyzing this data, the system generates movie recommendations for a given input movie.

Key Features:
- Content-based recommendation: The system suggests movies similar to the input movie based on their content and tags.
- Cosine similarity: The movie content is vectorized and the cosine similarity metric is used to calculate the similarity between movies.
- User-friendly web application: The recommendation system is presented as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively input a movie and receive recommendations.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas: Data manipulation and processing
- Scikit-learn: Text preprocessing and cosine similarity calculation
- NLTK: Stemming of text data
- Streamlit: Web application framework for building the user interface
- GitHub: Version control and project hosting

This project serves as an example of a content-based recommendation system and can be extended further by incorporating additional data or refining the recommendation algorithm.
